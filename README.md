# Interminable-Rooms-Script-2.0b
The second version of my interminable rooms script

New look, fixed functions, and updated code that works on a level 2 injector. Since byfron, scripting has been limited, but certain executor like solara is how I can keep making scripts, even if they're bare bones and make me want to kms :)
